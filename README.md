<h1 align="center">The Homie convention</h1>

Version: **2.0.0**.

Homie is a lightweight MQTT convention for the IoT.

You can find an implementation of the Homie convention:

* An Arduino library built for the ESP8266: [marvinroger/homie-esp8266](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266)
* ![WIP](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/thesquid-ink-40-free-flat-icon-pack/64/barricade-24.png) **WIP** - An opinionated Web UI built with Node.js: [marvinroger/homie-server](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-server)
* ![WIP](https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/thesquid-ink-40-free-flat-icon-pack/64/barricade-24.png) **WIP** - Some Node-RED nodes for automation: [marvinroger/node-red-contrib-homie](https://github.com/marvinroger/node-red-contrib-homie)
* A Python-implementation for Raspberry Pi & Co.: [jalmeroth/homie-python](https://github.com/jalmeroth/homie-python).

## Background

An instance of a physical piece of hardware (an Arduino, an ESP8266...) is called a **device**. A device has **device properties**, like the current local IP, the Wi-Fi signal, etc. A device can expose multiple **nodes**. For example, a weather device might expose a `temperature` node and an `humidity` node. A node can have multiple **node properties**. The `temperature` node might for example expose a `degrees` property containing the actual temperature, and an `unit` property. Node properties can be **ranges**. For example, if you have a LED strip, you can have a node property `led` ranging from `1` to `10`, to control LEDs independently. Node properties can be **settable**. For example, you don't want your `degrees` property to be settable in case of a temperature sensor: this depends on the environment and it would not make sense to change it. However, you will want the `degrees` property to be settable in case of a thermostat.

## QoS and retained messages

Homie devices communicate through MQTT.

The nature of the Homie convention makes it safe about duplicate messages, so the recommended QoS for reliability is **QoS 1**. All messages MUST be sent as **retained**, UNLESS stated otherwise.

## ID format

An ID MAY contain only lowercase letters from `a` to `z`, numbers from `0` to `9`, and it MAY contain `-`, but MUST NOT start or end with a `-`.

## Convention

To efficiently parse messages, Homie defines a few rules related to topic names. The base topic you will see in the following convention will be `homie/`. You can however choose whatever base topic you want.

* `homie` / **`device ID`**: this is the base topic of a device. Each device must have an unique device ID which adhere to the [ID format](#id-format).

### Device properties

* `homie` / **`device ID`** / `$` **`device property`**: a topic starting with a `$` after the base topic of a device represents a device property. A device property MUST be one of these:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Direction</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Retained</th>
    <th>Required</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$homie</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Version of the Homie convention the device conforms to</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$online</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td><code>true</code> when the device is online, <code>false</code> when the device is offline (through LWT)</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$name</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Friendly name of the device</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$localip</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>IP of the device on the local network</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$uptime/value</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Time elapsed in seconds since the boot of the device</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$uptime/interval</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Interval in seconds at which the <code>$uptime/value</code> is refreshed</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$signal</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Integer representing the Wi-Fi signal quality in percentage if applicable</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>No, this is not applicable to an Ethernet connected device for example</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$fw/name</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Name of the firmware running on the device. Allowed characters are the same as the device ID</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$fw/version</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Version of the firmware running on the device</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$ota</td>
    <td>Controller → Device</td>
    <td>Latest OTA version available for the device</td>
    <td>Yes or No, depending of your implementation</td>
    <td>No, OTA is optional</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$implementation</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>An identifier for the Homie implementation (example <code>esp8266</code>)</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$implementation/#</td>
    <td>Controller → Device or Device → Controller</td>
    <td>You can use any subtopics of <code>$implementation</code> for anything related to your specific Homie implementation.</td>
    <td>Yes or No, depending of your implementation</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For example, a device with an ID of `686f6d6965` with a temperature and an humidity sensor would send:

```
homie/686f6d6965/$online → true
homie/686f6d6965/$name → Bedroom temperature sensor
homie/686f6d6965/$localip → 192.168.0.10
homie/686f6d6965/$signal → 72
homie/686f6d6965/$fw/name → 1.0.0
homie/686f6d6965/$fw/version → 1.0.0
```

And it would receive:

```
homie/686f6d6965/$ota ← 1.0.1
```

At this point, your device would understand there is an OTA update available, as `$ota` is different from `$fw/version`.

### Node properties

* `homie` / **`device ID`** / **`node ID`** / **`property`**: `node ID` is the ID of the node, which must be unique on a per-device basis, and which adhere to the [ID format](#id-format). `property` is the property of the node that is getting updated, which must be unique on a per-node basis, and which adhere to the [ID format](#id-format).

Properties starting with a `$` are special properties. It must be one of the following:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Direction</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Retained</th>
    <th>Required</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$type</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Type of the node</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$properties</td>
    <td>Device → Controller</td>
    <td>Properties the node exposes, with format <code>id</code> separated by a <code>,</code> if there are multiple nodes. For ranges, define the range after the <code>id</code>, within <code>[]</code> and separated by a <code>-</code>. For settable properties, add <code>:settable</code> to the <code>id</code></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For example, our `686f6d6965` above would send:

```
homie/686f6d6965/temperature/$type → temperature
homie/686f6d6965/temperature/$properties → degrees,unit
homie/686f6d6965/temperature/unit → c
homie/686f6d6965/temperature/degrees → 12.07

homie/686f6d6965/humidity/$type → humidity
homie/686f6d6965/humidity/$properties → percentage
homie/686f6d6965/humidity/percentage → 79
```

A LED strip would look like this. Note that the topic for a range properties is the name of the property followed by a `_` and the index getting updated:

```
homie/ledstrip-device/ledstrip/$type → ledstrip
homie/ledstrip-device/ledstrip/$properties → led[1-3]:settable
homie/ledstrip-device/ledstrip/led_1 → on
homie/ledstrip-device/ledstrip/led_2 → off
homie/ledstrip-device/ledstrip/led_3 → on
```

* `homie` / **`device ID`** / **`node ID`** / **`property`** / `set`: the device can subscribe to this topic if the property is **settable** from the controller, in case of actuators.

Homie is state-based. You don't tell your smarlight to `turn on`, but you tell it to put it's `on` state to `true`. This especially fits well with MQTT, because of retained message.

For example, a `kitchen-light` device exposing a `light` node would subscribe to `homie/kitchen-light/light/on/set` and it would receive:

```
homie/kitchen-light/light/on/set ← true
```

The device would then turn on the light, and update its `on` state. This provides pessimistic feedback, which is important for home automation.

```
homie/kitchen-light/light/on → true
```

### Broadcast channel

Homie defines a broadcast channel, so a controller is able to broadcast a message to every Homie devices:

* `homie` / `$broadcast` / **`level`**: `level` is an arbitrary broadcast identifier. It must adhere to the [ID format](#id-format).

For example, you might want to broadcast an `alert` event with the alert reason as the payload. Devices are then free to react or not. In our case, every buzzer of your home automation system would start buzzing.

```
homie/$broadcast/alert ← Intruder detected
```

Any other topic is not part of the Homie convention.
