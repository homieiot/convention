<i align="center">A lightweight MQTT convention for the IoT</i>

## Motivation

The Homie convention strives to be a **communication definition on top of MQTT** between IoT devices and controlling entities.

> [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol.
> It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

MQTT supports easy and unrestricted message-based communication.
However, MQTT doesn't define the structure and content of these messages and their relation.
An IoT device publishes data and provides interaction possibilities but a controlling entity will need to be specifically configured to be able to interface with the device.

The Homie convention defines a **standardized way** of how IoT devices and services announce themselves and their data on the communication channel.
The Homie convention is thereby a crucial aspect in the support of **automatic discovery, configuration and usage** of devices and services over the MQTT protocol.
